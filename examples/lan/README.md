# Local Arena Network example over mDNS

This example established libp2p mesh network using randomly OS-assigned port.
A mDNS discovery protocol is used to detect peers in the same Local Arena Network and connect to them automatically over
TCP or QUIC protocol.

Network is used to distribute Yrs document updates generated by user commands.

### Run example

Since endpoint is assigned and detected automatically, there's no need for any additional config params. Just run
several processes using:

```bash
cargo run --example lan
```

This example generates Yrs document updates based on user command line inputs:

- `set <key> <value>` updates an Yrs Map entry with given `<key>=<value>` pair.
- `del <key>` deletes an entry from Yrs Map.
